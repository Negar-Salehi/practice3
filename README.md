Here is an overview of the additional tasks and functions:

### 1. `count_word`:
- **Objective:** Count the number of words in a given sentence.
- **Functionality:** The program takes a sentence input from the user and counts how many words are present. Words are typically separated by spaces.

### 2. `GCD` (Greatest Common Divisor):
- **Objective:** Calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
- **Functionality:** The user provides two numbers, and the program computes the GCD, which is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

### 3. `HangMan`:
- **Objective:** Implement the classic Hangman game.
- **Functionality:** The user tries to guess a word chosen by the program, one letter at a time. If the guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in the word. If incorrect, a part of a "hangman" is drawn. The user wins by guessing the word before the drawing is complete.

### 4. `LCM` (Least Common Multiple):
- **Objective:** Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
- **Functionality:** The user inputs two numbers, and the program calculates the LCM, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of both input numbers.

### 5. `make_list`:
- **Objective:** Create a list of non-repeating numbers.
- **Functionality:** The user inputs a number, and the program generates a list containing non-repeating random numbers up to the specified count or within a specific range.

### 6. `snake`:
- **Objective:** Generate a string pattern in the shape of a snake.
- **Functionality:** The user inputs a number, and the program produces a string with alternating `*` and `#` characters in a snake-like pattern. The pattern length corresponds to the user-provided number.

### 7. `sort_list`:
- **Objective:** Check if a given list is sorted or not.
- **Functionality:** The user inputs a list, and the program checks whether the list is sorted in ascending or descending order and returns the result.

### Running the Python Scripts:
To run each of these programs from the command line (cmd), follow these steps:

1. Open Command Prompt (cmd).
2. Navigate to the directory where your Python files are located using the `cd` command.
   ```bash
   cd path\to\your\python\files
   ```
3. Run the desired Python file by typing `python` followed by the filename:
   ```bash
   python p3.1.py
   ```

### Example:
If you want to run the **HangMan** game, ensure the Python file is named correctly (e.g., `HangMan.py`), then run:
```bash
python p3.2.py
```

### Note:
- Ensure that Python is correctly installed on your system and that the PATH environment variable includes the Python executable.
- Make sure that each Python script (`.py` file) is correctly written and placed in the directory from which you are running the command.
